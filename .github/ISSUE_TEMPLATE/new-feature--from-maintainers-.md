**Problem summary/missing feature:**  
Describe the missing feature or the problem found in the current implementation.  
Please remember that it is not a feature _request_ it is a feature added to the roadmap (if it comes from a request, it has been accepted).

**Expected behavior:**  
Describe here how the new feature is supposed to work and behave.

**Work to do:**  
Describe here the work to do _as precisely as possible_.  
For example: name files or modules that needs improvement, describe algorithms, etc.   
It is important as it allows us to discuss it before actual implementation.
