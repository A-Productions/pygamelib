    A GenericStructure is as the name suggest, a generic object to create all kind of structures.

    It can be tweaked with all the properties of :class:`~gamelib.BoardItem.BoardItem`, :class:`~gamelib.Immovable.Immovable` and it can be made pickable, overlappable or restorable or any combination of these.

    If you need an action to be done when a Player and/or a NPC touch the structure please have a look at :class:`gamelib.Structures.GenericActionnableStructure`.

    :param pickable: Define if the structure can be picked-up by a Player or NPC.

    :param overlappable: Define if the structure can be overlapped by a Player or NPC.
    :type overlappable: bool
    :param restorable: Define if the structure can be restored by the Board after a Player or NPC passed through. For example, you want a door or an activator structure (see GenericActionnableStructure for that) to remain on the board after it's been overlapped by a player. But you could also want to develop some kind of Space Invaders game were the protection block are overlappable but not restorable.
